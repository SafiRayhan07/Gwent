    <i><h1>Gwent a Card game in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</h1></i>
    <div class="Intro">
        <p>In the begining of this game you have to play some card games which is knows as <span class="Gwent">'Gwent'</span> and it's a very populer game in witcher 3 wild hunt as everyone willing to play <span class="Gwent">'Gwent'</span> XD. From shopkeeper to inkeep as well as sergent and quatermaster of a Royal Empire everyone is fond of <span class="Gwent">'Gwent'</span>.As the story goes it is not mandatory to playt this side game but an arcade player I realy appreciate this game. Who don't want an extra coin and special card by playing this game?</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="Blinker">Attention!!!</h2>
    <div class="subintro1"><p>As we are talking about <span class="Gwent">'Gwent'</span> let's have some introduction about Empires and Cards.</p></div>
    <div class="subintro2"><p>
        There are 5 Empires in GWENT. Each empires has their particular card which can't be used in other Empire(Unless Neutral Cards). These empires are:
    </p>
    <dl type="square">
        <dt class="Empire">Northern Realms:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/NorthernRealmsCB.png" class="Emp">
        <dd>It's basically the northern realms cosist of temeria and so on. They have some special hero card like (Vernon Roach, Jhon Natalis, Esterad Thyssen, Philippa Eilhart)</dd>
        <dt class="Empire">Nilfgaard:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/nilfgaard.jpg" class="Emp">
        <dd>Knows as the "Black ones". in my opinion Nilfgaardian empires have the special cards and most powerful random card so far. Their special cards are (Letho of Gulet, Menno Coehoorn, Morvaan Voorhis, Tibor eggebracht)</dd>
        <dt class="Empire">Scoia"tael:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/scoia'tel.png" class="Emp">
        <dd>This empires contains maily non humans. I usually not picked this empire cause their cards strength is low and most of the cards can be used as melle or ranged that;s the perk of this empire. you can string the cards and make a powerful strength with this empire.</dd>
        <dt class="Empire">Monsters:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/Monster.png" class="Emp">
        <dd>In early game monsters are like a terror to me. But when i realise that every empires has it's perk as well as it's weakness it make me soo confident against monster empire.their main strength is melee cards as the can add extra card from their deck it gives so much pain. but it's quit much easier when you have a simple environmental card Biting Frost or Scorch</dd>
        <dt class="Empire">Skellega:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/skellega.jpg" class="Emp">
        <dd>I haven't play this card as it only contains in DLC but further improvement will be announced in this section In sha Allah.</dd>
        <dt class="Empire">Neutral:</dt>
        <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/neutral.jpg" class="Emp">
        <dd>The main trump card are these section of cards as anyone can use these cards with any empire. So to be good in gwent one have to achieve these section cards as soon as possible and the combo with these cards and Nilfgaard is too much easier to win any gwent competetion.</dd>
    </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="subintro3"><p>There are some other section cards known as weather and special cards. These cards can't affect the special cards and only applicable for random general cards. These cards are:</p>
        <dl type="disk">
            <dt class="Environment">Biting Frost:</dt>
            <img src="My Gwent Deck/Picture/Cards/biting_frost_card.jpg" class="Env">
